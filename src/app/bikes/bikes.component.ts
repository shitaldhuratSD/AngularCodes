      description :'There would not have been a 160cc sporty commuter class in India had it not been for the Yamaha FZ16. It was the affordable aspirational motorcycle that the 125cc users could upgrade to that offered a different flavour to the Pulsars and the Apaches of the time â€“ and especially the Honda Unicorn, which was fairly conservative. Its muscular styling, punchy motor, sophisticated suspension setup and the chunkiest rear tyre that you could find on a 150/160cc motorcycle also helped it capture the attention of budding enthusiasts.
